# Study Summary: 
Embedding hepatitis C virus (HCV) screening during hospitalization can improve diagnosis of HCV; however, linkage to outpatient care is needed to ensure access to curative treatment. Since October 2023, Penn Medicine has implemented a default HCV screening and linkage program for adults admitted to the hospital to improve diagnosis of HCV viremia and allow for proactive linkage of such patients to outpatient HCV care. This project will evaluate the effectiveness of the program using the HCV Care Cascade framework to identify proportion of patient successfully completing each step along the care cascade to ultimate confirmation of HCV cure. The analysis will focus on identifying factors associated with successful HCV care engagement after linkage to outpatient HCV care among people with HCV viremia identified at time of hospitalization. The barriers and facilitators to care engagement will inform further programmatic interventions to improve access to curative HCV treatment.
